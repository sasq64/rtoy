# Acey Ducey
#
# From: BASIC Computer Games (1978)
#       Edited by David Ahl
#
# "This is a simulation of the Acey Ducey card game.
#  In the game, the dealer (the computer) deals two
#  cards face up.  You have an option to bet or not to
#  bet depending on whether or not you feel the next
#  card dealt will have a value between the first two.
#
# "Your initial money is set to $100. The game keeps
#  going on until you lose all your money or interrupt
#  the program.
#
# "The original BASIC program author was Bill Palmby
#  of Prairie View, Illinois."
#
# Ruby port by Christopher Oezbek, 2021
#
# This uses the following techniques:
#
#  - The programm largely consists of a GAME LOOP,
#    which is used to represent one round.
#  - The Kernel function rand(Range) is used to get an
#    Integer in the (inclusive) Range of 2 to 14.
#  - To ensure the user enters a proper Integer
#    via the console, an inline 'rescue' statement is
#    used.
#  - To capture the long text in the introduction, a
#    squiggly HEREDOC string declaration <<~ is used.
