# Checkers in Ruby, Version 1
#
# This version of the game attempts to preserve the underlying
# algorithm(s) and feel of the BASIC version while using more modern
# coding techniques.  Specifically:
#
# 1. The major data structures (the board and current move, known as S
#    and R in the BASIC version) have been turned into classes.  In
#    addition, I made a class for coordinates so that you don't always
#    have to deal with pairs of numbers.
#
# 2. Much of the functionality associated with this data has been moved
#    into methods of these classes in line with the philosophy that objects
#    are smart data.
#
# 3. While I've kept the board as a single object (not global, though),
#    this program will create many Move objects (i.e. copies of the move
#    under consideration) rather than operating on a single global
#    instance.
#
# 4. The rest of the code has been extracted into Ruby functions with
#    all variables as local as reasonably possible.
#
# 5. Pieces are now represented with Symbols instead of integers; this
#    made it *much* easier to understand what was going on.
#
# 6. There are various internal sanity checks.  They fail by throwing
#    a string as an exception.  (This is generally frowned upon if
#    you're going to catch the exception later but we never do that;
#    an exception here means a bug in the software and the way to fix
#    that is to fix the program.)
#
# And probably other stuff.
#


# Note: I've ordered the various major definitions here from (roughly)
# general to specific so that if you read the code starting from the
# beginning, you'll (hopefully) get a big-picture view first and then
# get into details.  Normally, I'd order things by topic and define
# things before using them, which is a better ordering.  So in this
# case, do what I say and not what I do.


#
# Some global constants
#

BOARD_TEXT_INDENT = 30  # Number of spaces to indent the board when printing

# Various constants related to the game of Checkers.
#
# (Yes, they're obvious but if you see BOARD_WIDTH, you know this is
# related to board dimensions in a way that you wouldn't if you saw
# '8'.)
BOARD_WIDTH = 8
KING_ROW_X = 0
KING_ROW_Y = BOARD_WIDTH - 1



# This is the mainline routine of the program.  Ruby doesn't require
# that you put this in a function but this way, your local variables
# are contained here.  It's also neater, IMO.
#
# The name 'main' isn't special; it's just a function.  The last line
# of this program is a call to it.

         Inspiration: Creative Computing  Morristown, New Jersey


          This is the game of checkers.  The computer is X,
          and you are O.  The computer will move first.
          Squares are referred to by a coordinate system.
                    (0,0) is the lower left corner
                    (0,7) is the upper left corner
                    (7,0) is the lower right corner
                    (7,7) is the upper right corner
          The computer will tell you when you have another
          jump.

          Enter a blank line if you cannot make a move.  If this
          not after a jump, it means you have lost the game.

# Class to represent the game board and all of the pieces on it.
#
# Like the BASIC version, the board is represented using an 8 by 8
# array.  However, instead of using numbers between -2 and 2, we
# represent board squares with Ruby symbols:
#
#   - :_ (underscore) is an empty square
#   - :o and :x (lowercase) are ordinary pieces for their respective sides
#   - :O and :X (uppercase) are kings for their respective sides
#
# Most of the smarts of the game are also here as methods of this
# class.  So my_turn() doesn't (e.g.) go through the board squares
# looking for the best move; it asks the board for it by calling
# bestMove().
