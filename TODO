# USABILITY

## Editor

* Undo/Redo
* Comment/Uncomment
* Mark text / Copy/Paste
* Indent/Unindent marked

## Web

* TextEdit -> Paste into R-Toy
* Upload/Download files
* Login: Persist files


# NOTES

kwargs to set state of layer...
layer has default style

push/pop style ?


## WHAT TO FIGURE OUT

* When to use floats vs ints, and how to convert?
* Move to doubles and rely on int fitting?
* Access to style object?
* Key mapping, and wether to get key up events
* require vs loading, hard rules. Many smaller components ?
