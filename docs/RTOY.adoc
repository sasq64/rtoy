= R-Toy

_R-Toy_ is a _programming environment_ and _runtime_ focused on learning
and playing. It is inspired by home computers of the 1980s.

It can roughly be split into two parts;

* The _native_ or _VHC_ (_virtual home computer_) part; written mostly in C/C++
* The OS / Application layer; written mostly in _ruby_.

== VHC

The _VHC_ lies at the core of the R-Toy project. It stands for _Virtual Home
Computer_ (or think of it as _Virtual Hardware Context_ in case _Home Computer_
is not something that has meaning to you).

The VHC is an _imaginary_ computer, and like a most computers, it has a
display, audio output, keyboard input, timers etc. But since we only intend to
program it using a high level language (ruby) we don't actually need to emulate
this machine on the hardware level.

Instead, we directly expose this virtual hardware a set of _ruby_ objects.

=== Display

A display represents the visible screen as a whole.  It is exposed as a
`Display` object. Normally there is only one display, and that instance can be
retrieved using `Display.default`.

The display has a few basic attributes, such as `width`, `height` and `bg`.
Mainly it is the parent of all layers where the actual rendering takes place.

[source,ruby]
----
    display = Display.default
    puts "#{display.width}x#{display.height}"
    display.bg = Color::BLACK
    # The draw handler is called every time the display is about to
    # be refreshed, usually 60 times per second.
    display.on_draw { display.clear() }
----

== Image

Even though images would not normally be considered part of the hardware of a
computer, for practical reasons they is considered "native" objects as far as
the VHC is concerned.

An image is a _view_ into a 2D array of pixels, normally backed by GL texture.
The view is represented by the _UV_ coordinates into the texture.

Loading an image from disk will create an image that references the entire
image.

Later the image can be duplicated, or split into many images. All these
derivative images will still refer to the original pixel array, and will
consume only a small amount of extra memory for the UV coordinates.

[source,ruby]
----
    img = Image.from_file("tiles.png")
    tiles = img.split(16,16)
    Display.canvas.draw(0, 0, tiles[10])
----

NOTE: Ideally, the loading of images, and the storing of CPU side pixels should
be placed in Ruby, while the native side of images should be restricted to
textures and UV coordinates. But since many image loading libraries are
implemented using C/C++ we put the entire _Image_ concept on the VHC side.

=== Layer

A _layer_ is a rectangular area of graphics used to build up the display.  Each
layer is rendered in order every frame. By default, the display has four
layers; Background, Console, Canvas and Sprites

=== Console

A console is a _tile_ layer, consisting of _W*H_ tiles, where _W_ and _H_
defaults to 256. It also has a _tile_size_ which is the pixel size of each
tile.

A console is initially used to display _text_, and so it is backed by a _font_
that is used to render all undefined tiles.

By default the _Unscii_ font is used, with a tile size of _8x16_.

Any tile can be redefined to refer to a different image, and this is a
convenient way to create tile based graphics.

The default console is exposed as `Display.default.console`.

[source,ruby]
----
    console = Display.default.console
    console.fg = Color::WHITE
    console.clear()
    console.text(10, 10, "Hello world")
----

=== Canvas

A _canvas_ is a layer used for general drawing, like lines and circles.

[source,ruby]
----
    canvas = Display.default.canvas
    canvas.circle(100, 100, 30)
----

=== Sprites

A _Sprites_ layer is not a single layer, but a collection of sprites.

[source,ruby]
----
    sprites = Display.default.sprites
    img = Image.from_file('ball.png')
    sprite = sprites.add_sprite(img)
    sprite.move(100, 100)
----

=== Audio

The audio object is used to output sound. By default there are 32 channels,
and each channel can be set to a different frequency. All even channels
are then mixed into the left speaker, and the odd one to the right.

[source,ruby]
----
    audio = Audio.default
    beep = (0..5000).map { |i| Math.sin(i/50) }
    sound = Sound.new(beep)
    # Play a beep on channel 0 (left speaker)
    audio.play(0, beep)
----

=== Input

[source,ruby]
----
    input = Input.default
    input.on_key { |key| puts "#{key} was pressed" }
    input.on_click { |x,y| sprite.move(x,y) }
    if input
----

=== Timer

[source,ruby]
----
    timer = Timer.default
    start = Timer.seconds()
    timer.on_timer(100) { |t| sprite.x = t - start }
----

== OS

The R-Toy "operating system" is a ruby layer on top of the native objects.
It extends the core functionality exposed by the _VHC_, and also simplifies
many things.

It is possible to bypass the OS and just use the VHC objects directly.

=== Boot Process

At startup, _R-Toy_ loads `main.rb`

`main.rb` begins by loading `os.rb` followed by other required ruby
modules.

Then the OS is "booted" by creating the main _Fiber_ that in turn normally
starts the _REPL_. Using ruby Fibers allows us to perform cooperative multi
tasking, even when not using real threads. This is what allows us to blocking
IO (such as _read_line()_) even when running in a web browser.

=== Applications

==== The REPL

The REPL continuously reads lines of text from the user and executes them.

==== The Editor

The editor is used to load,edit & run ruby code.

=== Shortcuts

* `display` refers to `Default.display`
* `console` refers to `Default.display.console`
