tween(args)

target(args)

A tween is a list of target. Mostly you can use the same arguments
for the parent tween as for the targets, in which they will
become default for all targets

Only keyword arguments are accepted, but there are some shortcuts.

`seconds`

`object`

`method`

`from`

`to`

`from_<attr>`

If the key starts with 'from_', we assume that
<attr> is a set/get method pair, in which case we
will tween from the given value to the current value
of the attribute.

`to_<attr>`

`ease`

Set the easing method to use

`<method>`

If the value is an object, it is assumed that
the key is a valid method in object.
