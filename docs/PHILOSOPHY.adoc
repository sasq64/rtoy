== The Concept

Let's walk through our requirements and see where that leads us.

A _programming environment_ and _runtime_ that is easy to understand and play
with.

To promote playing and experimentation, we want it to be;

=== Self-contained

Requiring the user to use and start different programs in an existing operating
system such as windows has a few problems;

It is hard to gain an understanding about how things work together.

There is too much noise; features of different systems and programs that are
not relevant to the programming process.

It is easy to get distracted.

We want a fullscreen experience that the user does not have to switch out of.

A good target device is a Raspberry PI running in console mode (X11 not booted);
here it is not even possible do start a web browser to do something else.

=== Coherent

We want the environment to have some underlying "metaphor" that promotes
understanding of the system. This is where the _VHC_ comes in.

Let's illustrate this with an example on how understanding can come from
a coherent underlying "hardware";

=== Example: Learning how text works

[source,ruby]
----
print("What is your name? ")
name = readln()
println("Hello #{name}")
----
The user notices that letters are ouput from left to right, and from top to bottom.

She starts to understand the concept of a "cursor position" that is increased
as text is output.

NOTE: A harder concept that the user probably does not understand at this point is _blocking IO_; what is really happening inside `readln()` ?

[source,ruby]
----
text 0,0, "top of the screen"
x = 0
loop {
   text x,2,"Moving text", Color::RED
   x = x + 1
   sleep 0.1
}
----
The user learns that text output takes place on a grid, and that it is possible
to place characters anywhere on that grid. She also learns that the each "cell"
in this grid can have different colors.

[source,ruby]
----
img = Image.from_file("ball.png")
console.define_tile('o', img)
# Display a ball image in the top left corner
console.text(0,0, 'o')
----

The user learns that characters are just images, and using tiles as letters is
just a special case -- and that the image representation of any tile can be
changed.
