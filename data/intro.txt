R-Toy is what I like to call a Virtual Home Computer. It is
a text based interface to an underlying imaginary computer,
programmed in Ruby.

Its ultimate goal is to replicate the magical experience of
playing with, and learning programming on a home computer
of the 80s, but in a way that is approachable to current
generations of humans.

It can be used to play/experiment with basic programming.

It can be used to prototype small games.

Mostly it can be used for fun!
